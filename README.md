# Fruits Teller - Apple vs Banana Classifier

## Description

Fruits Teller is a machine learning model that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of fruits into two categories: apples and bananas. The model is trained on a large dataset of fruit images to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these two popular fruits.

## Model Details

- Model Architecture: The classifier is built using a CNN architecture, which is well-suited for image recognition tasks.
- Dataset: The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing images of apples and bananas from various angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds.
- Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed to ensure consistency and improve training performance.
- Training: The model is trained using a supervised learning approach, optimizing for accuracy and minimizing classification errors.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using a separate test set to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## How to Use the Model

To use the Fruits Teller model for apple vs banana classification, follow these steps:

1. Input Image: Provide the model with an image containing either an apple or a banana (or a region of interest containing the fruit).
2. Classification: The model will analyze the input image and predict whether it contains an apple or a banana.
3. Output: The model will return the prediction along with the associated confidence score.

## Dependencies

- The model may have specific dependencies on deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on its implementation.

## Model Integration

There are several ways to integrate the Fruits Teller model into your projects:

1. **Python API**: You can use the model through a Python API, passing images as inputs and receiving the classification results.
2. **Web Service**: Deploy the model as a web service or REST API for easy access from various platforms.
3. **Mobile Application**: Integrate the model into a mobile app for on-device fruit classification.

## Performance and Limitations

- The Fruits Teller model is designed to classify images of apples and bananas specifically and may not work accurately with other types of fruits.
- The model's performance depends on the quality and diversity of the training dataset. Additional fine-tuning or data augmentation may improve results.
- The model may struggle with poorly lit or heavily occluded images of fruits.
